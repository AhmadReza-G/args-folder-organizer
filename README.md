4. Select the folder you want to organize.

## How it works

The app scans your selected folder and its existing subfolders (ignoring folders created during the operation), then applies selected transformations to file names and file locations safely. If a rename conflicts with an existing file, the original file is moved to a `duplicate` folder inside the same directory.
